 --><h2>Version 1 vs version 2</h2><p>Version 2 is a significant upgrade in terms of ease-of-use and power compared to
version 1. In brief, the difference is that
</p><ul><li>Version 1 only generated one merged ConfigZilla.xslt file when you compiled
the ConfigZilla project. Because of this properties such as $(MSBuildProjectName)
were always made in the context of the ConfigZilla project. This made it difficult
to use per-project customisations: you had to rely on Xsl Parameters, the syntax
for which is rather clunky, and they couldn't be referenced in .targets files.</li><li>Version 2 generates a merged ConfigZilla.xslt file for each project in which you
have installed ConfigZilla. Properties such as $(MSBuildProjectName) are always
evaluated in the context of the project being compiled, <strong>NOT</strong>
ConfigZilla. This makes it easy to compose per-project settings such as log file
names. Furthermore, you can use them in .targets files, not just .xslt files.
</li></ul><h2>Considerations for upgrading</h2><p>Upgrading via NuGet should be automatic. The upgrade script will delete two files
from your ConfigZilla folder, "ConfigZillaCreateXslt.targets" and "ConfigZilla.Tasks.dll".
Neither of these are needed anymore. References to them will also be removed
from ConfigZilla.csproj, which may cause a warning about needing to reload the project file.
</p><p>There are no changes to any of your .targets and .xslt files in your Transforms folder,
except that the "czp" automatic Xsl Parameters are no longer gathered. If you were
using these, please convert to using MSBuild properties instead.
</p><p>You can now create a Transforms folder in each project being compiled; the contents
of these will be included after the ConfigZilla\Transforms folder, thus giving
the ability to override the values set in ConfigZilla\Transforms. Most users
will not need this feature and will be able to keep all their transformations
centralised in ConfigZilla\Transforms.
</p><p>The XmlDeserializeConfigSectionHandler class now supports validation using
System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations attributes and the DefaultValue
attribute. n.b. If upgrading from version 1.*, the copy of XmlDeserializeConfigSectionHandler
in your ConfigZilla project will NOT be upgraded in case you have made your own
customisations to it. To workaround this, create a ConsoleApp, install ConfigZilla
into it, and then just copy-and-paste the class into your existing project.</p><hr><a href="index.html">Table Of Contents</a><!--script.--><!--	window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')--><script  src="js/plugins.js"></script><script  src="js/main.js"></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your sites ID.--><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
