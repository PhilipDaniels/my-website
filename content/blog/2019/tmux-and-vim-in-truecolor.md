You will need to compile tmux from source, you need tmux v2.2 at least.

Also need to compile Vim from source, see [https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source)

Then you need to get tmux working with TrueColor. See [https://deductivelabs.com/en/using-true-color-vim-tmux/](https://deductivelabs.com/en/using-true-color-vim-tmux/), especially the comments about **.tmux.conf**.
And [https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/FAQ](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/FAQ)
