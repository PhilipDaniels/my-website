# Ordering

In January this year I succumbed to temptation, and with the New Year bike sales in full
swing, I decided to buy a new bike to replace my Van Nicholas Yukon, which is now 14 years
old. It's still going strong, but I wanted to upgrade to new technologies such as hydraulic
disk brakes, electronic shifting, lower gearing and wider, more comfortable tubeless tyres.

I considered various bikes such as the Giant Defy (too Gianty), the Trek Domane (too spendy)
and the Vitus Venon. The latter would have been a shoo-in if they'd sell the 105 Di2 version
in a colour other than silver - my Van Nic is titanium and I wanted a change to something
with a little bling.

I eventually decided on a [Ribble CGR SL](https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-cgr-sl-shimano-105-di2/)
with Shimano 105 di2. My choice was swayed by the fact that it looked a pretty good deal,
they were fairly local in Clitheroe, and that I could get a custom paint job - away with
boring bike colours! I do mainly endurance riding (Audaxes) and Ribble have a bike called
"Endurance" - which is not actually an endurance bike, it's more of a race bike. So that
bullet dodged, I went to Clitheroe and had a bike fit. I'd used Ribble's online configurator
before going and just went through the choices again. All in all it probably only took
about 30 minutes to complete the order. I went for the Zipp 303 Firecrest wheel upgrade
which bumps the price up quite a bit but they get rave reviews. Bonus: I got 2 years interest
free credit, so the total price of £4133 was spread over 24 payments of £172 each. And the
first payment only goes out when they actually ship the bike. Can't argue with that really.
The only downside is the waiting time - I ordered on the 11th of January, and the frames
aren't expected in stock until the first week of April, plus there is extra time for the
custom colour paint job. Overall I was looking at end of April to first week of May before
I got my bike. That's a long time, but since the weather is pretty dire at this time of year
and I couldn't beat the price, I decided to go with it.

A week later I decided to change my custom colour from Teal to Maillot Jaune - a
quick online chat with a customer service representative got this done. I also asked
them to mail me a copy of the actual full spec that I had ordered, because bizarrely,
their online order page doesn't show that at all and I never received any sort of
email confirmation of the build spec.

# Waiting

In total I was looking at 111 days from initial order to expected delivery. Let me tell
you that really drags. During that time I "amused" myself by reading some of the online
reviews of Ribble bikes. Quite a few people online complaining about their quality control,
including around their [custom painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5h8MEMZz9w).
I came very close to cancelling my order
and going to a local Trek shop and buying a Domane in my size - yes they had stock! But
then I read James Huang's [Velo](https://velo.outsideonline.com/ebike/2023-trek-domane-review/)
of that bike and his criticism of the exposed headset bearings was a bit of a shocker. Given
that Audax rides in the UK will see their fair share of unavoidable terrible weather conditions
(24 hours of rain in Wales anyone?) I got cold feet on that too.
