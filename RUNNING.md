You need to install hugo separately

    $ sudo apt install hugo

The main website is cloned from https://github.com/PhilipDaniels/my-website
(of course).

You will also need to clone https://github.com/PhilipDaniels/philipdaniels.github.io
into the public folder.

Once you have done that, use the `publish` script to build the website into the `public`
folder and push all the files to **both** git repos.
