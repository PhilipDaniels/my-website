# my-website

Sources for my (mainly) Hugo-based website.

# TODO
* [ ] Integrated search
* [ ] RSS
* [ ] Port ConfigZilla pages, including GA
* [ ] Rebuild my gitcheatsheet?
* [ ] Navigation issues
    * [ ] Clicking Phil's Blog should take you to a TOC for the blog
    * [ ] I should have a link at the left to take you to my 'portfolio',
          which is just a TOC for the overall site.
    * [ ] The LHS should have explicit links for the blog, rust-for-cs, and Linux cheats?
    * [ ] Clicking on a tag with no other posts results in a 404
* [ ] Layout issues
    * [ ] Dates on TOC are not nice, want full year. TOC should be arranged by year too.
    * [ ] The width of the overall blog is too narrow
    * [ ] Make headings and main font smaller
    * [ ] Decrease line spacing?
