* [ ] Need a favicon
* [ ] Rebuild my gitcheatsheet?
* [ ] Navigation issues
    * [ ] Clicking Phil's Blog should take you to the 'posts' page
    * [ ] The LHS should have explicit links for the blog, rust-for-cs, and Linux cheats?
* [ ] Layout issues
    * [ ] Dates on TOC are not nice, want full year. TOC should be arranged by year too.
    * [ ] The width of the overall blog is too narrow
    * [ ] Make headings and main font smaller
    * [ ] Decrease line spacing?
